I'm Noam, I am a **research fellow** at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, working with [Dr. Abhilasha Ravichander](https://lasharavichander.github.io/).  

I care a lot about how NLP systems meet real people and real information. My work focuses on evaluation and on building methods that help models reflect diverse users and support healthier information ecosystems. We are currently working on NLP questions related to factuality, framing, omission, and nuanced forms of misleading content. I'd love to connect if you're working similar topics! 

I completed my master’s in Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/), where I worked on multilingual datasets and evaluation approaches in NLP (see **Publications** tab for more info:) ).

In my past life, I spent over five years as a **journalist**: as a news editor at [Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz) and earlier at Galei Tzahal. So yes, I’ve always loved text (and factuality!).

**I am seeking PhD opportunities in NLP groups, specifically those committed to human-centered AI.**
