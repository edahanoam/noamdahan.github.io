# Shalom and Willkommen!

I am a **research fellow** at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, working with [Dr. Abhilasha Ravichander](https://lasharavichander.github.io/).I care about how NLP systems interact with real people and real information. My research focuses on evaluation and on building methods that help models reflect diverse users and improve our information ecosystem. We are currently working on NLP questions related to factuality, framing, omission, and nuanced forms of misleading content.

I completed my master’s in Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/), focusing on multilingual datasets and evaluation approaches in NLP.

In my past life, I spent over five years as a **journalist**: as a news editor at [Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz) and earlier at Galei Tzahal. So yes, I’ve always loved text (and factuality!).

**I am seeking PhD opportunities in NLP groups, specifically those committed to human-centered AI.**
